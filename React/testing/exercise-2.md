# React Testing Library Exercise 2 (Testing an Input Component)

## Description

This exercise involves writing tests for an Input component using React Testing Library.

## Approach

1. Create a new React component called Input that renders an input element with a label and type passed as props.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the Input component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the Input component when the user types into the input.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the Input component.
2. Use `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or `getByPlaceholderText` to query for the input element.
3. Use `fireEvent.change` to simulate user input events.

## Deliverables

1. A working Input component that renders an input element with a label and type passed as props.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the Input component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the Input component when the user types into the input.
