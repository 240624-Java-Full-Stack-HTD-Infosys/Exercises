# React Testing Library Exercise 3 (Testing a Form Component)

## Description

This exercise involves writing tests for a Form component using React Testing Library.

## Approach

1. Create a new React component called Form that includes multiple input elements.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the Form component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the Form component when the user submits the form.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the Form component.
2. Use `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or `getByPlaceholderText` to query for the input elements.
3. Use `fireEvent.change` to simulate user input events on the input elements, and `fireEvent.submit` to simulate the form submission.

## Deliverables

1. A working Form component that includes multiple input elements.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the Form component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the Form component when the user submits the form.
