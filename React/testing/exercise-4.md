# React Testing Library Exercise 4 (Testing Component State)

## Description

This exercise involves testing a functional component that uses the useState hook to manage some state and display it in the UI.

## Approach

1. Create a new functional component that uses the useState hook to manage some state and display it in the UI.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the component when the user interacts with it.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the component.
2. Use `getByRole`, `getByText`, or other query functions to query for the elements that display the state.
3. Use `fireEvent` to simulate user interaction events, such as clicking on a button to change the state.

## Deliverables

1. A working functional component that uses the useState hook to manage some state and display it in the UI.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the component when the user interacts with it.
